    <!-- What is z-index in CSS? -->
    In CSS, z-index is property that is used to determine the stack level(z-axis value) of the element. 
    Elements having higher z-index value will be placed on top of the element having lower index value.
    It takes values in negative as well as positive.
    Note :- z-index will only work on an element whose position is set to either absolute, relative and fixed.
